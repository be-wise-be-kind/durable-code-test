# Purpose: Soak test profile for detecting stability issues over extended duration
# Scope: Extended-duration load test identifying memory leaks, connection exhaustion, and drift
# Overview: Defines a soak test profile with 30 concurrent users over 30 minutes.
#     Intended for detecting stability issues that only manifest over extended periods:
#     memory leaks, connection pool exhaustion, file descriptor leaks, and gradual performance
#     degradation. Uses a moderate user count with long duration to accumulate enough cycles
#     for leak detection. The 70/30 HTTP-to-WebSocket weight ratio maintains standard traffic
#     distribution while the extended duration exposes resource management issues.
# Dependencies: Locust load testing framework, mixed_users.py locustfile
# Exports: Profile configuration consumed by justfile --profile flag and profile_loader.py
# Environment: Dedicated test environment with monitoring for resource tracking
# Related: smoke.yml for validation, load.yml for baseline, stress.yml for peak load
# Implementation: Flat YAML structure with fields mapped to Locust CLI arguments and
#     environment variables by the justfile or profile_loader.py
