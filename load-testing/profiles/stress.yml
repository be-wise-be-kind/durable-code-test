# Purpose: Stress test profile for identifying application breaking points under heavy load
# Scope: High-concurrency load test pushing the application beyond normal operating capacity
# Overview: Defines a stress test profile with 200 concurrent users over 10 minutes.
#     Intended for identifying application breaking points, error thresholds, and degradation
#     patterns under heavy load. The 60/40 HTTP-to-WebSocket weight ratio increases WebSocket
#     pressure relative to other profiles, stressing the oscilloscope streaming endpoint with
#     more concurrent connections. Results reveal capacity limits, error rate curves, and
#     response time degradation under peak load conditions.
# Dependencies: Locust load testing framework, mixed_users.py locustfile
# Exports: Profile configuration consumed by justfile --profile flag and profile_loader.py
# Environment: Dedicated test environment (avoid running against shared resources)
# Related: smoke.yml for validation, load.yml for baseline, soak.yml for endurance
# Implementation: Flat YAML structure with fields mapped to Locust CLI arguments and
#     environment variables by the justfile or profile_loader.py
