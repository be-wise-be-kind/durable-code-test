# Purpose: Smoke test profile for quick validation of load testing infrastructure
# Scope: Minimal load test verifying HTTP and WebSocket scenarios function correctly
# Overview: Defines a lightweight smoke test profile with 5 users and 30-second duration.
#     Intended for rapid validation that the load testing infrastructure, Locust scenarios,
#     and target application are all functioning correctly before running heavier profiles.
#     Uses an 80/20 HTTP-to-WebSocket weight ratio to emphasize HTTP endpoint coverage
#     while still validating WebSocket connectivity.
# Dependencies: Locust load testing framework, mixed_users.py locustfile
# Exports: Profile configuration consumed by justfile --profile flag and profile_loader.py
# Environment: Local development or CI/CD pipeline quick-check
# Related: load.yml, stress.yml, soak.yml for progressively heavier test profiles
# Implementation: Flat YAML structure with fields mapped to Locust CLI arguments and
#     environment variables by the justfile or profile_loader.py
