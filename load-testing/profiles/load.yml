# Purpose: Standard load test profile simulating typical production traffic patterns
# Scope: Moderate load test with sustained user count for baseline performance measurement
# Overview: Defines a standard load test profile with 50 concurrent users over 5 minutes.
#     Intended for measuring baseline application performance under typical production-like
#     traffic patterns. The 70/30 HTTP-to-WebSocket weight ratio reflects expected real-world
#     usage where HTTP API calls significantly outnumber WebSocket streaming sessions.
#     Results from this profile establish performance baselines for comparison against
#     stress and soak test results.
# Dependencies: Locust load testing framework, mixed_users.py locustfile
# Exports: Profile configuration consumed by justfile --profile flag and profile_loader.py
# Environment: Local development or staging environment performance testing
# Related: smoke.yml for quick validation, stress.yml for peak load, soak.yml for endurance
# Implementation: Flat YAML structure with fields mapped to Locust CLI arguments and
#     environment variables by the justfile or profile_loader.py
