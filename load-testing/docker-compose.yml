# Purpose: Docker Compose orchestration for Locust load testing service
# Scope: Single-service configuration for running Locust against deployed web instances
# Overview: Defines the locust-master service that runs the Locust load testing framework
#     with a web UI on port 8089. Targets external URLs (deployed web instances) configured
#     via the LOCUST_HOST environment variable, which defaults to the LOAD_TEST_HOST value
#     from the project .env file or can be overridden at runtime. Volume-mounts locustfiles
#     for live editing during test development. Workers are deferred to a later PR.
# Dependencies: Docker Compose, Dockerfile in same directory, LOAD_TEST_HOST env var
# Exports: Locust master service with web UI
# Interfaces: Port 8089 (Locust web UI), LOCUST_HOST env var for target URL
# Environment: Local Docker runtime, targeting deployed web instances
# Related: Dockerfile for image build, locustfiles/ for test scenarios, justfile for commands
# Implementation: Single master service with volume mount for locustfiles and env-based host config
