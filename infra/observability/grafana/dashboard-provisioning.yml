# Purpose: Grafana dashboard provisioning configuration for automatic dashboard loading
# Scope: File-based dashboard provisioning from the dashboards directory
# Overview: Configures Grafana to automatically load dashboard JSON files from the provisioned
#     dashboards directory. Dashboards are loaded on startup and cannot be modified through the
#     UI (read-only provisioning). This ensures dashboards are version-controlled and consistently
#     deployed across environments. The dashboards directory is volume-mounted from the host.
# Dependencies: Dashboard JSON files in /var/lib/grafana/dashboards/
# Exports: Provisioned dashboards available in Grafana UI
# Environment: Identical across environments
# Related: docker-compose.yml for volume mount, dashboard JSON files added in PR 7
# Implementation: File-based provisioning with folder organization and update interval
