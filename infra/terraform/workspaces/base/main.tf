# Purpose: Main configuration for base infrastructure workspace containing persistent resources
# Scope: Terraform backend configuration, provider requirements, and workspace-aware local values
# Overview: This file establishes the foundation for the base infrastructure workspace which manages
#     persistent resources that are expensive to recreate and should survive runtime deployments.
#     It configures the S3 backend for state management with workspace-specific state files, defines
#     provider requirements for AWS resources, and establishes workspace-aware naming conventions
#     and tagging strategies. The base workspace includes VPC, NAT Gateways, ECR repositories,
#     Route53 zones, ACM certificates, and the Application Load Balancer itself. These resources
#     form the foundation that runtime resources depend upon via data sources.
# Dependencies: AWS provider, S3 backend bucket, DynamoDB lock table, backend-config files
# Exports: Local values for workspace naming, environment extraction, and common tags
# Configuration: Backend configuration provided via backend-config/base-{env}.hcl files
# Environment: Supports dev, staging, and production with workspace-based separation
# Related: networking.tf, ecr.tf, dns.tf, alb.tf, outputs.tf in this workspace
# Implementation: Uses Terraform workspace naming convention base-{env} for state isolation
