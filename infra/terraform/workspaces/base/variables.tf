# Purpose: Variable definitions for base infrastructure workspace configuration
# Scope: Input variables for persistent base resources including networking, DNS, and registries
# Overview: Defines all input variables required for the base infrastructure workspace which manages
#     persistent resources that form the foundation of the application infrastructure. These variables
#     control the configuration of VPC networking, availability zones, NAT Gateway enablement, ECR
#     repositories, Route53 zones, and ACM certificates. Each variable includes validation rules to
#     ensure proper values and sensible defaults optimized for different environments. The variables
#     support cost optimization through optional resource creation and environment-specific sizing.
# Dependencies: Used by all resource files in the base workspace
# Exports: Variables available for use throughout the base workspace configuration
# Configuration: Overridden by environment-specific tfvars files (dev.tfvars, staging.tfvars, prod.tfvars)
# Environment: Supports dev, staging, and production with environment-specific defaults
# Related: terraform.tfvars.example for sample values, outputs.tf for exposed values
# Implementation: Validation blocks ensure data integrity, defaults optimize for cost
