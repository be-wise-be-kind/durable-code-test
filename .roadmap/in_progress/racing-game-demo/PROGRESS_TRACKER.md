# Racing Game Demo - Progress Tracker & AI Agent Handoff Document

**Purpose**: Primary AI agent handoff document for racing game demo feature with current progress tracking and implementation guidance

**Scope**: Complete feature development lifecycle from planning through implementation with AI agent coordination and progress tracking

**Overview**: Primary handoff document for AI agents working on the racing game demo feature.
    Tracks current implementation progress, provides next action guidance, and coordinates AI agent work across
    multiple pull requests. The racing game will be a cartoonish, physics-based racing game where the car follows
    the mouse cursor. Features include procedural track generation, collision physics, timing system, and reusable
    architecture following the oscilloscope demo patterns.

**Dependencies**: React frontend, Canvas API for rendering, Physics engine for realistic car behavior, existing demo infrastructure

**Exports**: Progress tracking, implementation guidance, AI agent coordination, and feature development roadmap

**Related**: AI_CONTEXT.md for feature overview, PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed tasks

**Implementation**: Progress-driven coordination with systematic validation, checklist management, and AI agent handoff procedures
