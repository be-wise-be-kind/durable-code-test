## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write tests first, then implementation
- **Reference implementation available**: `/home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/`
- **Binary severity model**: Errors only, no warnings
- **File-based initially**: File placement linter doesn't require AST parsing
- **5 ignore levels**: repo (.thailintignore), directory, file, method, line

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Don't skip writing tests first
- ❌ Don't implement before tests exist
- ❌ Don't merge PRs with failing tests
- ❌ Don't forget to update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- ❌ Don't skip the reference implementation review

### Resources
- **Reference Implementation**: `/home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test/tools/design_linters/`
- **Existing Test Patterns**: `tests/test_cli.py` (Click CliRunner examples)
- **Project Context**: `.ai/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- **Roadmap Workflow**: `.roadmap/how-to-roadmap.md`
